Onism is a high-performance CLDR library for .NET. It allows you to create an efficient binary file for (optionally subsetted) CLDR data and browse its contents easily.

## Specs & Getting started
Please see the [wiki]. It will help you [get started](https://github.com/pgolebiowski/Onism.Cldr/wiki/Getting-started).

## What is CLDR?

The Unicode CLDR provides key building blocks for software to support the world's languages, with the largest and most extensive standard repository of locale data available. This data is used by a wide spectrum of companies (see below) for their software internationalization and localization, adapting software to the conventions of different languages for such common software tasks.
